Mythology!

  In college, I minored in mythology and watched almost every episode of the game show, Jeopardy!.
  Incorporating both helped me build this project with the stocked knowledge I have between the two.

  Next Steps: 
  - Design / Update CSS better.
  - Add Dark Mode.
  - Add more difficulties (Easy and Hard)
  - Add animations before and after the game (e.g. confetti after the game)
  - Add more themes besides Mythology.
